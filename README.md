**The goal**: Create an **app or a game in Unity** that uses data persistence with a **relational** database.

**What are we building**: An **Admin Panel** for managing a store data (products, employees...) and user information.

**The Stack**: Unity for the front-end, MySQL as the database, C# as the language for both application logic and database interactions.
